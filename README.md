# PIC16A-Project
Penguins Project
Stephen, Glenda, Armine, and Ryan
For our group project, we decided to do the clustering penguin analysis. We will work with a dataset containing features such as sex, island of origin, species, flipper length, etc. for over 300 penguins. Our goal will be to construct two different models using the KNN algorithm and decision tree/random forest algorithm and compare their performance on predicting the species of penguins. First, we will do EDA to show which features are correlated to our response variable, see the distribution of our data, and check cross-feature correlation. Next, we will use cross-validation to select the best features and hyperparameters. Finally, we will display our results which will be their accuracy scores on testing data. 
Python Packages Used: pandas 1.3.4, matplotlib ???, seaborn 0.11.2, and sklearn 1.1.3
Description of Demo File: ??? (with 2 figures embedded)
Scope and Limitations: There are no ethical concerns, but there are some limitations to the data. The Palmer Penguins dataset only contains data on 3 species of penguins. If we wanted to learn more about all species of penguins, this dataset would not be enough to answer all of our questions. A possible extension using a dataset with more data from all species of penguins would allow us to visualize data on all species of penguins.

The dataset used is Palmer Penguins. This is a dataset containing various measurements of 3 different species of penguins collected in the Palmer Archipelago by Dr. Kristen Gorman. We used the .csv file found on Canvas.
