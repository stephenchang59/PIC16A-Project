# PIC16A-Project
Penguins Project
Stephen, Glenda, Armine, and Ryan
For our group project, we decided to do the clustering penguin analysis. We will work with a dataset containing features such as sex, island of origin, species, flipper length, etc. for over 300 penguins. Our goal will be to construct two different models using the KNN algorithm and decision tree/random forest algorithm and compare their performance on predicting the species of penguins. First, we will do EDA to show which features are correlated to our response variable, see the distribution of our data, and check cross-feature correlation. Next, we will use cross-validation to select the best features and hyperparameters. Finally, we will display our results which will be their accuracy scores on testing data.
